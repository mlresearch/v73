title: Reducing the Cost of Probabilistic Knowledge Compilation
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are a popular representation for reasoning under
  uncertainty. The computational complexity of inference, however, hinders its applicability
  to many real-world domains that in principle can be modeled by BNs. Inference methods
  based on <i>Weighted Model Counting</i> (WMC) reduce the cost of inference by exploiting
  patterns exhibited by the probabilities associated with BN nodes. However, these
  methods require a computationally intensive compilation step in search of these
  patterns, limiting the number of BNs that are eligible based on their size. In this
  paper, we aim to extend WMC methods in general by proposing a scalable, compilation
  framework that is language agnostic, which solves this problem by partitioning BNs
  and compiling them as a set of smaller sub-problems. This reduces the cost of compilation
  and allows state-of-the-art innovations in WMC to be applied to a much larger range
  of Bayesian networks.
